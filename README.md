# Awesome Pizza

Awesome Pizza wants a python script that users can run to order predefined pizzas.

The user should be able to:

* Add pizza from a list of cheese or pepperoni pizzas
* Remove pizzas from their list of selected pizzas
* Display their list of selected pizzas with the total cost
* Place an order, which displays a list with total cost of what they ordered and clears their list of selected pizzas
